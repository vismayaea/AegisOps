"""What the ReAct loop needs from whoever runs it.

The loop calls back out for a handful of things — emitting events, narrowing the
tool list, queued follow-ups, and the optional provider hooks. ``LoopHost``
is that set of callbacks as a ``Protocol``: ``run_react_loop`` depends only on it
(plus an ``AgentRunInput``), so it never has to know about ``Agent`` — any object
with these methods can drive the loop. ``Agent`` is the usual one.
