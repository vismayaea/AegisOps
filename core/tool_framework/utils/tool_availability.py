"""Shared unavailable-payload helper for agent tools.

Every tool that can't reach its backend (missing config, failed auth, no
client) returns the same base envelope shape: ``{"source", "available":
False, "error"}``, sometimes with vendor-specific extra keys layered on top.
This module gives that shape one implementation instead of each integration
reconstructing it by hand.

Downstream classifiers (e.g. evidence L0 degradation) must recognize this
envelope structurally — never by scanning observation prose for words like
``unauthorized`` or bare ``"available": false`` inside ordinary result rows.
