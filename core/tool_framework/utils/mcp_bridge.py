"""Shared unavailable-response builder for MCP bridge tools.

Every MCP bridge tool (``posthog_mcp``, ``sentry_mcp``, ``x_mcp``)
returns the same degraded payload when it can't reach its backend: the base
``tool_unavailable`` envelope, optionally annotated with the ``tool`` that was
being dispatched and the ``arguments`` it was called with. This module holds
that one shape so each bridge doesn't reconstruct it by hand.
