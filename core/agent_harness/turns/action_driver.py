"""Action tool-calling turn driver (decoupled from any terminal surface).

Runs one turn through the shared :class:`core.agent.Agent` tool-calling
loop: it assembles the available agent tools (via a :class:`~core.agent_harness.ports.ToolProvider`),
drives the loop while a tool-event observer streams each tool call to the
surface, and summarizes the executed tool calls into a facts-only
:class:`~core.agent_harness.turns.turn_results.ToolCallingTurnResult`.

Accounting/analytics for the turn are the caller's concern (see
:class:`core.agent_harness.ports.TurnAccounting`); this module emits none itself.
