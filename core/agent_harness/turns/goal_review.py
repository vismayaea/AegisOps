"""LLM goal reviewer for action and evidence-gather turns.

Builds a :class:`~core.agent.goals.Goal` whose ``verify`` asks the turn's own
LLM one small review question when the agent concludes after executing tools.
If the verdict is ``NOT_REACHED`` the ReAct loop nudges the agent to continue.
Two flavors share the same reviewer:

* :func:`build_goal_reviewer` — action turns ("remove the cron loops" must not
  stop after only listing them).
* :func:`build_gather_goal_reviewer` — evidence-gather turns (a data question
  must not stop at tool/schema discovery without executing the actual query;
  observed live: three PostHog turns in a row ended on MCP tool listings and
  never ran the count the user asked for).

The review is deliberately conservative — a wrong ``NOT_REACHED`` makes the
agent flail through extra actions the user never asked for (observed live:
duplicate async dispatches). It fails open on any LLM error, runs at
most once per turn, and is skipped entirely when no tools ran, when the agent
is asking the user a question, or when the turn ran a tool whose outcome is
not reviewable this turn (async dispatch, assistant handoff).

The reviewer learns which tools ran through :func:`tap_executed_tool_names`
(action) or :func:`tap_executed_tool_calls` (gather — needs args so discovery
vs metric ``call_*_tool`` can be distinguished).
