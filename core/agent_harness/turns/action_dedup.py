"""Suppress replayed action-tool calls within one turn.

A guarded tool (``slash_invoke`` / ``shell_run`` / ``cli_exec``) that the model
re-emits with identical arguments after it already succeeded this turn is
blocked, so a stuttering model cannot run the same side-effecting command
twice. Kept apart from the turn driver: this is a self-contained hook policy,
not part of driving the loop.

    Suppress ``slash_invoke`` / ``shell_run`` / ``cli_exec`` when the call's
    fingerprint is in ``last_fully_succeeded_batch`` *or* already succeeded
    earlier in the current provider batch (same-batch duplicates). Guarded
    tools are sequential, so ``batch_succeeded`` is visible to the next
    ``before()`` in the batch.

    Snapshot updates at the next batch boundary:

    - Fully successful batch → replace snapshot with that batch (so A → B → A
      still allows the second A after B replaces the snapshot).
    - Mixed batch (suppressed replay + new success) → replace snapshot with
      *only* the newly succeeded fingerprints. That blocks an immediate re-emit
      of the new action without retaining suppressed members (which would block
      a later intentional standalone replay of A after {A suppressed, C ran}).
    - Pure suppress or total failure → leave the snapshot alone (a third
      identical replay stays blocked; failed calls may still retry).

    Limitation (intentional): the same batch twice in one turn — lone or
    multi — is also suppressed; accidental replay and “run that again” are
    indistinguishable without parsing the user message. Ask again next turn.
