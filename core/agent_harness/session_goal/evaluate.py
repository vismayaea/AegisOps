"""SessionGoal completion — structured verdict, not model self-report alone.

The action/assistant model may emit ``session_goal:achieved``. That tag is a
claim, not proof. This module is the independent host check:

* Checklist complete (via ``done=`` indices) → achieved.
* ``achieved`` with tool evidence on an incomplete **short** checklist (≤2
  items) → complete the checklist (same-turn query+report) and achieve. A
  longer checklist keeps explicit ``done=`` tracking, so the claim is ignored.
* ``achieved`` with an incomplete checklist and **no** tool evidence → stay
  active (ignore the tag).
* Short checklist (≤2 items), no prior-turn progress, tools succeeded, and a
  non-empty reply → achieve even when the model only tagged part of the
  checklist (e.g. ``done=0`` for query, forgot report) or omitted tags
  entirely — avoids a redundant session-goal turn that repeats the answer.
* ``achieved`` on a **host-owned** (``/goal set``) goal → achieved without tools
  (explicit slash-path product rule).
* Host-owned goal, **no** ``achieved`` tag, but tools succeeded (action **or**
  gather) and the reply is non-empty → achieve (same-turn answer). Waiting for
  a scrubbed/forgotten tag forced a redundant outer turn that repeated the
  live answer. Gather successes count: metric handoffs often leave action
  ``executed_success_count`` at 0. Final-route identity alone
  (``cli_agent_fallback`` / summarize) is not evidence — unsupported fallbacks
  must not close the goal.
* Host-owned goal whose reply reports cohort identity unverified (product
  refuse + draft path) → achieve without requiring gather successes.
  Models often stop before a count query; staying ACTIVE forced a redundant
  outer turn.
* ``achieved`` with no checklist on a handoff goal → require tool evidence, or
  stay active.
* Hosts may wrap :func:`evaluate_session_goal` with an LLM confirm for the
  tool-evidence path (:mod:`core.agent_harness.session_goal.confirm`).
