"""Shell action-agent system prompt text.

The stable base lives in ``opensre_system_prompt.md`` (loaded at import time)
so the long planner prompt is editable as data and packaged with the wheel.
That file is the OpenSRE action-planner contract (handoff vs direct answer,
compound turns, slash mapping) — not a coding-agent / Codex clone.
