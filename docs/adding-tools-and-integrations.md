# Adding Tools & Integrations — Definition of Done

Use this checklist whenever you add or materially change:

- a tool — under `integrations/<vendor>/tools/` for a single-vendor tool, or `tools/system/` / `tools/cross_vendor/` for a cross-cutting one (see [tool-placement-policy.md](tool-placement-policy.md))
- an integration under `integrations/<name>/` — its config, client, verifier, and tools

This is the detailed definition of done; use it with [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [CI.md](../CI.md).

## 1. Tool checklist

### Files usually involved

- `integrations/<vendor>/tools/<tool_name>_tool/__init__.py` — the tool package (most common path: the tool belongs to a vendor integration)
- `tools/system/<tool_name>/` or `tools/cross_vendor/<tool_name>/` — only when the tool is not vendor-specific (e.g. `tools/system/sre_guidance_tool/`)
- `integrations/<name>/client.py` — reuse a dedicated integration API client instead of inlining requests
- `core/tool_framework/utils/` — shared helper code reused across vendors
- `docs/<tool_name>.mdx` — user-facing usage, parameters, examples
- `tests/tools/test_<tool_name>.py` — behavior and regression coverage

Tools are registry-discovered from **both** `tools/` and `integrations/<vendor>/tools/`, so placement is about ownership, not discovery — see [tool-placement-policy.md](tool-placement-policy.md). Wherever a tool lives, it calls integration-local clients/helpers rather than inlining transport, and never lives in a top-level `vendors/` or `services/` package.

Tool packages must be substantive production modules — no empty or discovery-only `__init__.py`, no thin wrapper that only satisfies registry import. Any tool with validation, credential/parameter resolution, transport/client calls, output normalization, or error handling should split those concerns into focused sibling files (`tool.py`, `models.py`, `validation.py`, `delivery.py`/`client.py`, `results.py`), leaving `__init__.py` as a small registry entrypoint that imports the public tool object.

### Contract and implementation

- [ ] Pick the simplest shape that fits (`@tool(...)` for lightweight tools, a richer class only when needed)
- [ ] `__init__.py` is a small registry entrypoint; non-trivial tools use sibling modules for implementation concerns
- [ ] Metadata is complete and accurate: `name`, `description`, `source`, `surfaces`, `requires`, and any `use_cases` / `outputs` / `retrieval_controls`
- [ ] `input_schema` matches the actual runtime arguments and required fields
- [ ] `is_available` returns `True` only when the tool can genuinely run
- [ ] `extract_params` maps resolved integration state into tool args correctly
- [ ] Validation, credential/parameter resolution, transport/client calls, and result formatting are separated so each can be tested independently
- [ ] Reusable transport or integration-specific parsing lives in `integrations/<name>/` or `core/tool_framework/utils/`, not copied into the tool body
- [ ] Failure responses have a stable, agent-friendly shape; expected external failures (missing config, auth, rate limit, upstream 4xx/5xx) return structured errors rather than raising — unexpected exceptions use the global `BaseTool` wrapper intentionally or are migrated with telemetry coverage
- [ ] Output is normalized enough for the agent/LLM to consume reliably
- [ ] Secrets never leak through `extract_params`, return values, logs, or traceable tool-call kwargs; secret/PII output is run through `infrastructure/safety/masking/` before return
- [ ] External side effects declare `side_effect_level`, `requires_approval`, and `approval_reason` where appropriate
- [ ] To appear in both chat and action turns, set `surfaces=(ToolSurface.CHAT, ToolSurface.ACTION)`

### Live payload parsing

If the tool parses API, MCP, log, or webhook payloads:

- [ ] Validate against the real or documented upstream response shape, not only idealized mocks
- [ ] Handle alternate field names used in live payloads
- [ ] Handle missing or partial fields without returning unusable output
- [ ] Preserve important context when truncating, tailing, paginating, or flattening data
- [ ] Upstream 429 / 5xx responses return a clear, agent-friendly error rather than raising
- [ ] Add at least one regression test using a realistic fixture payload

Common failure modes to consider: grouped + ungrouped log content; nested/foldered resources; paginated responses; `hasMore` / cursor mismatches; content-vs-pointer shapes (`logs_content` vs `logs_url`-style payloads).

### Skill guidance (optional)

A tool can carry workflow guidance the model reads on every call by shipping a `SKILL.md`. The guidance is **appended to the tool's `description`** under a `Workflow guidance:` heading — it is permanent schema text, not a side channel. All guidance targeting one tool is combined and truncated at **2400 characters** (`tools/registry_skill_guidance.py`), so budget it like description text: the longer the guidance, the more of every request it consumes.

Skill guidance and a harness playbook are **independent and composable** — a tool may have both. Skill guidance rewrites one tool's description; it does not replace agent- or harness-level guidance for a multi-step flow. The GitHub tools (`github_cli`, `ci_fix`, `security_fix`) each ship a `SKILL.md`; adding one never means removing broader guidance.

**When to add (two independent axes — evaluate both):**

| Axis | Add when | Skip when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tool `SKILL.md`** (this section) | ≥2 of: misuse is expensive; not obvious from the tool `description`; reused across many turns | One clear tool; thin/rare vendor; tip that fits in `description` |
| **Harness playbook** (`core/agent_harness/prompts/skills/*/SKILL.md` + `skill_view`) | Multi-step WHEN / DO NOT, sibling carve-outs, same-turn vs next-turn, or a report template | Single-tool tip with no cross-turn flow |

**Neither** is the default for most of ~70 `tools/` packages. Missing `SKILL.md` is usually correct. **Never** add one-per-vendor stubs, or one skill per observability vendor when the failure mode is shared (query hygiene is one class, not Datadog + Grafana + CloudWatch copies).

Harness authoring template: `core/agent_harness/prompts/skills/_template/SKILL_TEMPLATE.md`.

**File.** A `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and a markdown body:

```yaml
---
name: github-cli          # required — lowercase kebab-case, ≤ 64 chars
description: >            # required — ≤ 1024 chars; the model reads this to decide relevance
  One or two sentences: when to reach for these tools.
tools:                    # required — the registered tool name(s) this guidance applies to
  - github_cli
disable-model-invocation: false   # optional — set true to suppress attachment entirely
---

# Body — markdown workflow guidance shown after the tool's own description.
```

**Register it, or it is silently ignored.** The loader reads only files it is told about:

- [ ] **Explicit:** add the file's path to `_skill_guidance_files()` in `tools/registry_skill_guidance.py`. A `SKILL.md` that exists on disk but is absent from that tuple is **never loaded** — unlisted and missing files are skipped with no diagnostic, the same trap as forgetting a `docs.json` entry.
- [ ] Or place it under `tools/system/python_execution_tool/skills/*/SKILL.md`, which is discovered automatically.

**Check the registry-load logs** — the loader warns and skips rather than failing the build:

- `unknown_tool` — a name under `tools:` matches no registered tool; that target is dropped.
- `invalid_metadata` — missing `name`/`description`/`tools`, an over-long `name`/`description`, or a `name` that is not lowercase kebab-case; the whole skill is skipped.
- `parse_failed` — malformed frontmatter YAML.

## 2. Integration checklist

### Files usually involved

- `integrations/<name>/__init__.py` — package facade: a docstring, plus re-exports of the
  public API when callers need them (see the `__init__.py` rule in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md))
- `integrations/<name>/config.py` — config model, `classify()`, validators, selectors,
  normalization helpers
- `integrations/<name>/client.py` — a dedicated API client, when the integration makes direct remote calls
- `integrations/<name>/verifier.py` — local verification logic
- `integrations/<name>/tools/<tool_name>_tool/` — the vendor's agent-callable tools (see §1)
- `integrations/catalog.py` — resolve the integration into the shared runtime config
- `integrations/verify.py` — wire the local verification path
- `docs/<name>.mdx` — user-facing setup, usage, verification
- `tests/integrations/test_<name>.py`, plus `tests/tools/` or `tests/e2e/` where tools or scenarios exercise it

`integrations/<name>/` owns everything about one vendor — config, resolution, clients, verifiers, helpers, **and its tools**. Only vendor-less (`tools/system/`) and cross-vendor (`tools/cross_vendor/`) tools live under top-level `tools/`.

### Examples from the repo

- Datadog: `integrations/datadog/` (with `integrations/datadog/tools/`), `integrations/catalog.py`, tests under `tests/integrations/datadog/` and `tests/tools/test_datadog_*.py`.
- Grafana: `integrations/grafana/` (with `integrations/grafana/tools/`), `integrations/catalog.py`, `surfaces/cli/wizard/local_grafana_stack/`, tests under `tests/integrations/grafana/` and `tests/tools/test_grafana_*.py`.
- Bitbucket: `integrations/bitbucket/` shows the facade layout — a one-line `__init__.py` beside `config.py`, `client.py`, `verifier.py`, and `tools/`.

### Core completeness

- [ ] Config, normalization, validators, and `classify()` are in place under `integrations/<name>/config.py`, leaving `__init__.py` a facade
- [ ] Catalog resolution / env loading is wired correctly
- [ ] Verification path is wired in `integrations/verify.py` and adapters/registry as needed
- [ ] Integration-local client added under `integrations/<name>/client.py` (only if it makes direct remote calls)
- [ ] Tool layer is wired and stable
- [ ] CLI setup flow is updated if the integration is user-configurable locally
- [ ] `opensre integrations setup <name>` parity is added, or intentionally documented as out of scope
- [ ] New required env vars / credentials are added to `.env.example` (never `.env`)
- [ ] Sensitive credentials follow the [Credential resolution](#credential-resolution) contract below
- [ ] `make verify-integrations` passes

### Credential resolution

Secret env names and non-secret config follow different write/read paths.
Keep this contract when adding or changing an integration.

| Surface | Write (wizard / setup) | Read (runtime) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Integration store (`~/.opensre/integrations.json`) | Always on setup | First (preferred) |
| Local credentials file (`~/.opensre/credentials.json`) | Secrets via `sync_env_secret` | Via `resolve_env_credential` when env is unset |
| `.env` / process env | Public config and secrets (`sync_env_values` / `sync_env_secret`) | Plain `os.getenv` for that tier; `resolve_env_credential` reads env first |

**Hard rules for new code**

- Never use bare `os.getenv` for a secret env name (`*_TOKEN`, `*_KEY`, `*_PASSWORD`, `*_SECRET`, connection strings, and similar). Use `resolve_env_credential` from `config.llm_credentials` (env first, then the credentials file).
- Webhook / `*_URL` values are **never** written to the credentials file (wizard routes them to store/`.env`, not `sync_env_secret`). Read with store → plain `os.getenv` only. Webhook URLs often **embed** a secret token — treat them like passwords for logging/masking.
- Leave `load_env_integration_services` plain-env-only (startup-safe; no credentials-file read at boot).
- Store still wins in `resolve_effective` / merge — env/credentials-file is the fallback tier only.
- Tools receive credentials through `extract_params` (resolved integration state), never their own env reads. At execution, keys listed in the tool's `injected_params` override model-supplied values, so the verified source wins even when the model passes a token. A tool's resolver may read env only as the final fallback when nothing was injected — `integrations/github/tools/github_cli/credentials.py` is the reference: explicit/injected token first, then `GITHUB_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, then `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN`.
- Set `OPENSRE_DISABLE_KEYRING=1` to skip local-file reads/writes (env and store still work).

Canonical helpers: `resolve_env_credential` (env → credentials file), `sync_env_secret` / `save_credential` (secret writes to the credentials file and `.env`), `sync_env_values` (`.env` keys, including secrets).

## 3. Discovery and edge cases

For tools that list, search, or inspect resources:

- [ ] Folder/nested resource layouts are considered where the upstream supports them
- [ ] Large result sets are capped or paginated intentionally
- [ ] Partial fetches are surfaced clearly (`truncated`, `fetch_error`, etc.)
- [ ] Time/order-sensitive results preserve causal ordering where it matters

## 4. Docs and tests

### Docs

- [ ] Ship or update a `docs/` page/section in the same PR (new tool, CLI command, agent behavior, or integration; and whenever a tool's API/schema or an integration's setup changes)
- [ ] Any new `docs/` page is registered in `docs/docs.json` (without the `.mdx` suffix) so Mintlify navigation shows it

### Tests

- [ ] Unit tests for config/normalization
- [ ] Tool contract tests, or equivalent schema/metadata coverage
- [ ] A registry/discovery test proves the tool is visible on the expected surface(s)
- [ ] Runtime behavior tests for success and failure paths
- [ ] At least one realistic fixture for live-payload parsing when external payloads are involved
- [ ] A test proves the agent can discover or invoke the tool through the normal runtime path
- [ ] `tests/integrations/` updated when integration wiring changes

Green tests are not enough if they only cover idealized mocks.

### Final gate (new integrations)

Everything above is complete, **and**:

- [ ] Screenshot or demo GIF showing the integration working end-to-end
- [ ] E2E test added
- [ ] CI checks pass (see [CI.md](../CI.md))

## 5. Reviewer focus

Before opening or approving the PR, confirm the items most often missed are handled **explicitly**: tool placement (§1), live-payload robustness (§1), onboarding/setup/docs parity (§2 and §4), pagination/truncation/partial-response behavior (§3), and tests that cover realistic payloads and usefulness to the agent — not only happy-path mocks (§4).
