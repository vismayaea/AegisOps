# OpenSRE architecture

How the OpenSRE codebase is structured: the eight first-party packages, what
each is responsible for, and which may depend on which. These dependency rules
are CI-enforced (`make check-imports`), so they are real invariants rather than
aspirations.

## The layer stack

The packages sit in five tiers. **Higher tiers may import lower tiers; a lower
tier may never import a higher one.** Packages on the same tier are peers — the
last column says whether peers may import each other.

| Tier | Packages | May import | Must never import | Peer rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (top) | `surfaces`, `gateway` | `bootstrap`, `tools`, `integrations`, `core`, `infrastructure`, `config` | — | Independent peers; must not import each other, except three tracked CLI/REPL gateway-command edges listed in `.importlinter.strict`. |
| 2 | `bootstrap` | `tools`, `integrations`, `core`, `infrastructure`, `config` | `surfaces`, `gateway` | Composition root. The only package that may import `tools` **and** `integrations` together, because wiring needs both. |
| 3 | `tools` | `core`, `infrastructure`, `config` | `surfaces`, `gateway`, `bootstrap` | Peer of `integrations`: must not import it. Existing edges are listed as debt in `.importlinter.strict`. |
| 3 | `integrations` | `core`, `infrastructure`, `config` | `tools`, `surfaces`, `gateway`, `bootstrap` | Peer of `tools`: must not import it. |
| 4 | `core`, `infrastructure` | `config` | `surfaces`, `gateway`, `bootstrap`, `tools`, `integrations` | Siblings: **may** cross-import each other. |
| 5 (bottom) | `config` | — (nothing first-party) | everything above | Independent — imports no other first-party package. |

The shortcut: **dependencies point downward only.** A surface can reach all the
way down; `config` can reach nothing. The single deliberate exception is
`core ⟷ infrastructure`, a mutually-dependent pair by design (see below).

    SURFACES --> BOOT
    GATEWAY --> BOOT
    SURFACES --> TOOLS
    SURFACES --> INTEGRATIONS
    GATEWAY --> TOOLS
    GATEWAY --> INTEGRATIONS
    BOOT --> TOOLS
    BOOT --> INTEGRATIONS

    TOOLS --> CORE
    TOOLS --> INFRA
    INTEGRATIONS --> CORE
    INTEGRATIONS --> INFRA

    CORE <--> INFRA

    CORE --> CONFIG
    INFRA --> CONFIG
```

The arrows show edges between **adjacent** tiers to keep the diagram readable.
The actual rule is broader: a tier may import **any** tier below it, not only
the one directly beneath — so a surface may import `config` directly, and a
tool may import `infrastructure`. Refer to the "May import" column above for the
complete set of allowed edges.

## The layers in detail

### Tier 1 — `surfaces` and `gateway`

The entry points a human or an external system talks to. Nothing first-party
may import from here, so a surface can be added or removed without touching the
layers below it.

- **`surfaces/`** — one folder per UI/client: `surfaces/cli` (the stateless
  `opensre <command>` runner), `surfaces/interactive_shell` (the stateful
  REPL), and `surfaces/shared` for code two or more surfaces use. A surface
  owns its own I/O, prompts, and presentation, and composes lower layers to do
  the actual work. The two terminal surfaces are peers and do not import each
  other (`tests/shared/test_surface_border.py` pins both directions at zero);
  what both need lives in `surfaces/shared` — `terminal/` (output tracking,
  tables, prompts, banner, health and feedback rendering), `llm_setup/`,
  `error_handling/` — or a lower layer. `surfaces/entrypoint.py` is the
  `opensre` console script: it hands the CLI a `CliHost` (how to open the
  shell, how to run the gateway attached) and hands the shell the CLI's Click
  group for grounding, so composition happens in one place above both. Slack is not a surface: its inbound
  transport lives in `gateway/transports/slack`, outbound delivery in
  `integrations/slack`.
- **`gateway/`** — the standalone messaging gateway for inbound chat platforms
  (`gateway/transports/{telegram,slack,discord,buzz}`), plus the FastAPI
  `gateway/web/` surface (health, alert intake) and the
  shared per-turn machinery in `gateway/core/{session,storage,middleware}`
  (`middleware/` holds the inbound-decision, identity, and approval steps every
  transport composes). A peer of `surfaces`, not a child.

### Tier 2 — `bootstrap`

The **composition root** for process and harness wiring. Hosts (`surfaces`,
`gateway`) cannot import each other, and `tools` / `integrations` are peers that
must not import each other — yet registering harness adapters needs both
capability packages. `bootstrap/` is the only package allowed to import `tools`
**and** `integrations` together.

Every entrypoint boots through `configure_process(<profile>)` from
`bootstrap/process.py`: a profile (CLI, gateway, web, scheduler worker,
embedded) selects which boot steps run, and the step order is fixed by this
package — profiles cannot invent a different sequence. Adapter and
scheduler-runner registration lives in `bootstrap/adapters.py` and nowhere
else; surfaces and gateway used to keep peer copies — do not reintroduce them.

Host-owned concerns stay out of this package: CLI/gateway logging, Rich product
ports, CLI’s update-tolerant Sentry init.

### Tier 3 — `tools` and `integrations`

The capability layer — "do a thing against the outside world" — split by
responsibility:

- **`integrations/`** — the boundary for **user config and external clients**:
  per-vendor config normalization, verification (`verifier.py`), API clients
  (`client.py`), the store/catalog that resolves credentials, and
  integration-local helpers. One folder per vendor (`integrations/datadog`,
  `integrations/grafana`, `integrations/github`, …) plus cross-cutting pieces
  like `integrations/llm_cli`.
- **`tools/`** — the **agent-callable** boundary: every `@tool(...)` function
  and `BaseTool` subclass, the tool registry, framework subsystems
  (`tools/interactive_shell`), `tools/system/` for
  tools with no vendor in their domain purpose (`fleet_monitoring`,
  `python_execution_tool`, `sre_guidance_tool`), and
  `tools/cross_vendor/` for tools whose logic spans 2+ vendor integrations
  (`fix_sentry_issue`). See
  [tool-placement-policy.md](tool-placement-policy.md) for the full decision
  rule, including when a tool belongs under `integrations/<vendor>/tools/`
  instead. A tool is what the planner selects and the runtime executes.

The import rule between them is one-directional: `integrations` must never
import `tools` (or `surfaces`), so a vendor client never depends on the agent
layer and stays reusable on its own. The reverse edge is allowed and common — a
tool reaches an integration's client for external data — so `integrations`
effectively sits one step below `tools` in the dependency graph. Do **not**
reintroduce top-level `vendors/` or `services/` packages — external-system code
belongs in `integrations/`, agent-callable code in `tools/`.

### Tier 4 — `core` and `infrastructure`

The shared runtime and cross-cutting services the capability layer is built on.

- **`core/`** — the provider-agnostic agent runtime: the think → call tools →
  observe loop (`core.agent.Agent`), agent state (`core/state`) and
  context-budget enforcement (`core/context_budget.py`), tool contracts, schema,
  registry ports, execution, and error reporting (`core/tool`), tool authoring
  helpers (`core/tool_framework`),
  shared LLM clients (`core/llm`), agent-harness
  session handling (`core/agent_harness`), and pure domain rules (`core/domain`).
- **`infrastructure/`** — cross-cutting services with no agent logic of their
  own: guardrails, masking, sandbox, analytics, auth, notifications,
  observability, scheduler, deployment, and the shared **turn host**
  (`turn_host`) — the single `TurnRunner` the interactive shell and every
  gateway transport run turns through, so the two entry paths cannot drift.
  Deploy-time assets live under
  `infrastructure/deployment/` (EC2/packaging Python tooling plus the
  `cloudflare_install_proxy` edge worker); these are not imported by the app.

These two are the one bidirectional pair by design: `core` reaches `infrastructure`
for guardrails, masking, observability, and evidence/log compaction, while
`infrastructure` reaches back into `core` for the shared state and session types
(`core.state`, `core.agent_harness.session`). Splitting them into
separate tiers would forbid that edge, so they share a tier as siblings.

### Tier 5 — `config`

The floor: shared constants, prompts, and UI theme. Everything above may
read from `config`, but `config`
imports no other first-party package — keeping it a leaf means constants can be
imported anywhere without dragging runtime along.

## Cross-layer flows

Two worked examples showing how control descends the stack and results flow back
up. Arrows only ever cross a boundary downward.

### A chat turn from the interactive shell

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["surfaces/interactive_shell\n user question"] --> B["core/agent_harness\n session + turn orchestration"]
    B --> C["core/agent\n ReAct loop, context budget, LLM"]
    C --> D["tools\n registry + agent-callable tools"]
    D --> E["integrations\n vendor clients + credentials"]
    C --> F["infrastructure\n guardrails, masking, observability"]
```

1. The shell (or a gateway transport) hands the message to the shared agent
   harness in `core/agent_harness` — the surface never runs agent logic itself.
2. The harness runs the ReAct agent (`core/agent`): think → call tools →
   observe, under the context budget.
3. Tools selected by the agent reach `integrations` for vendor clients and
   resolved credentials; `infrastructure` supplies guardrails and masking
   around every call.
4. The answer flows back up to the surface, which owns how it is presented or
   delivered.

### An inbound gateway message

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["gateway/transports\n inbound chat message"] --> B["gateway/core session + storage\n resolve conversation state"]
    B --> C["tools + core\n run the requested capability"]
    C --> D["infrastructure\n notifications, observability"]
```

`gateway` receives a message, resolves session state from its own storage, then
composes the same tier-3 capability code a surface would (after shared
`bootstrap` process boot) — without ever importing `surfaces`, since the two
are independent tier-1 peers.
