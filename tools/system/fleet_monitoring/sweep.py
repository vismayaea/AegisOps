"""Orphan and stale-lockfile cleanup for the local agent registry.

Idempotent — running twice in a row is a no-op the second time. Removes
``AgentRegistry`` entries whose PIDs no longer exist plus lockfiles in
``~/.opensre/agents/`` that correspond to dead PIDs.

Liveness is checked via ``pid_exists`` rather than ``probe()``
because ``probe()`` returns ``None`` for two distinct reasons —
"PID doesn't exist" and "PID exists but I can't access its fields"
(``psutil.AccessDenied``, common for cross-user processes on macOS
or with a hardened ``/proc``). Treating both cases as "dead" would
silently delete records and lockfiles for live processes owned by
other users. ``pid_exists`` is the right primitive: it does an
OS-level existence check that doesn't traverse the access boundary.
