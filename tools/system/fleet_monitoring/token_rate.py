"""Per-PID rolling token-rate tracker.

The dashboard's ``tokens/min`` cell is a *rate*, not a cumulative
count: each row shows tokens emitted over the last 60 s. Meters
parse a chunk into a count; this tracker accumulates per-PID into a
sliding window.

Concurrency: the sampler writes from an asyncio executor while the
view reads from a worker thread. A single ``threading.Lock`` guards
the inner dict.

Time source: ``time.monotonic()``. ``time.time()`` would let an NTP
step or manual clock adjustment evict the entire window (jump
forward) or freeze it (jump backward).
