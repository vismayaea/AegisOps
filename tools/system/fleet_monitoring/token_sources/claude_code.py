"""On-disk JSONL source for Claude Code session events.

Claude Code writes ``~/.claude/projects/<mangled-cwd>/<session>.jsonl``
where ``<mangled-cwd>`` is the absolute cwd with ``/`` replaced by
``-``. We tail that file rather than ``/proc/<pid>/fd/1`` because
``tail.py`` rejects TTY targets, and most developers run claude-code
in an interactive terminal.
