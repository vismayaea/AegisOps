"""Sentry issue-fix tool: paste a Sentry issue URL and a coding agent proposes (and optionally ships) the fix.

Resolve the issue from Sentry, run the configured coding agent (via the neutral
``integrations/coding_agent`` seam; Pi today) in the **current workspace**, and
return a summary + git diff for review. When ``open_pr`` is requested (and the ship
gate is enabled), it then commits the fix to a fresh namespaced branch, pushes it,
and opens a GitHub pull request into the base branch. It **never** pushes to the
base/``main`` branch — the fix always lands on an ``opensre/sentry-fix-*`` branch and
is proposed via PR.

Package layout (separation of concerns):

- ``errors.py``    — :class:`FixIssueError` + stable ``error_kind`` constants.
- ``context.py``   — Sentry URL parse + issue fetch, compacted into a masked task.
- ``runner.py``    — opt-in gates, coding-agent readiness, the coding run, ship
  orchestration, and result shaping.
- ``ship.py``      — sequence branch -> commit -> push -> PR into a :class:`ShipResult`
  (git primitives live in ``integrations/git``; PR creation in ``integrations/github``).
- ``__init__.py``  — this file: the agent-facing :class:`BaseTool` contract. The
  class lives here because the tool registry discovers instances by
  ``__class__.__module__`` and does not recurse into sub-modules.

Gating: ``is_available`` is True only when ``PI_ISSUE_FIX_ENABLED`` is set (the fix
capability). Opening a PR requires a **second** opt-in, ``PI_ISSUE_FIX_SHIP_ENABLED``,
plus a GitHub token. Secrets (Sentry/GitHub tokens) never enter the coding-agent
prompt, the commit, the PR body, or the returned output — the issue context is masked.
