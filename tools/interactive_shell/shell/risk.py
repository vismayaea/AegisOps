"""Coarse risk classification for a mutating shell command.

Turns a command that already needs approval into a ``(risk, why)`` pair so the
confirmation card can show a human-readable impact and offer an "always allow
commands like this" option. Read-only commands never reach here — they run
without approval — so every classified command changes state; the only question
is how reversible that change is.

The classifier is deliberately conservative: an unrecognized mutation is
``MEDIUM``, and anything matching a destructive or remote pattern is ``HIGH``.
It never reports ``LOW`` for a command it does not positively recognize as a
small, local, reversible write.
