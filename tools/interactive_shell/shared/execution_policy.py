"""Central execution policy (allow / ask / deny) for interactive REPL tools.

Alpha mode: allow everything
----------------------------
OpenSRE is in **alpha**, and the interactive REPL runs with **no command
guardrails** so developer velocity stays high. Every policy decision below
resolves to ``allow`` and nothing prompts for confirmation: slash/``opensre``
commands (any tier), synthetic tests, code-agent launches, LLM
runtime switches, and shell commands of every kind — read-only, mutating,
``restricted`` (``sudo``, ``systemctl``, ``kill``, ``dd`` …), shell operators
(``| && ; > <``), and command substitution (`` ` ``/``$(...)``) — all run
immediately, in any context (TTY or not, trust mode or not).

There is intentionally **no shell-command safety policy**: the former
read-only / mutating / restricted classification and its deny floor were removed
(see ``docs/interactive-shell-action-policy.md``). The only thing shell
evaluation still rejects is genuinely empty input (a bare ``!`` or whitespace),
which is input validation rather than a guardrail.

The ``ask`` verdict is retained so that ``trust_mode``, ``/auto`` (Off/Low/Med),
and any future opt-in stricter policy still have a hook. ``allow_tool`` still
returns ``allow``; :func:`apply_auto_level` may promote that to ``ask``. High
(the default) never does. If a shell-command allowlist is reintroduced after
alpha, gate it here at the execution stage (not the planner).

This module is intentionally **pure**: it has no terminal I/O, no analytics, and
no console dependency. The decision is computed by :func:`resolve_confirmation`,
and the interaction layer (printing the reason/hint, the
``Command to approve`` prompt, and analytics emission) lives in
``interactive_shell.ui.execution_confirm.execution_allowed``.

Shell-specific evaluation (empty-input rejection, ``plan_shell_execution``)
lives next to the rest of the shell machinery in
``tools.interactive_shell.shell.policy`` and reuses the contracts defined here.
