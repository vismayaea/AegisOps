"""Shared contracts reused across interactive-shell tools.

This package is the single import path for the cross-tool execution policy:
``from tools.interactive_shell.shared import ...``. Tool modules should import
the policy contracts and helpers from here rather than from the underlying
``execution_policy`` module.
