"""Discord integration verifier — bot-token probe against ``/users/@me``.

A single GET with the bot token proves the token is valid, and it needs no
third-party client. The previous implementation logged in with ``discord.py``
(an optional dependency that is usually absent, and whose blocking ``client.run``
does not belong in a setup probe), so it reported every token as "discord.py is
not installed". This is now the one prober both the CLI and the onboarding
wizard use.
