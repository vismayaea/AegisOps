"""One place that turns collected credentials into a fully configured integration.

Setting an integration up happens on three surfaces — the onboarding wizard
(``opensre onboard``), ``opensre integrations setup <service>``, and the
interactive-shell action tools. Each one only differs in how it *collects*
values; what has to happen afterwards is identical:

1. every required field is present,
2. the credentials actually work (the integration's verifier — which is also
   where a rule spanning several fields belongs, so an incomplete combination
   is rejected by the same prober that runs on health checks),
3. references the user typed are resolved to what the runtime needs (optional,
   integration-specific — see :attr:`IntegrationSetupSpec.resolve`),
4. they are persisted to **every** tier that reads them — the integration
   store, the system keyring for secrets, and the project ``.env`` for the rest,
   and
5. any post-save side effect runs (optional — see
   :attr:`IntegrationSetupSpec.finalize`).

Before this module each surface reimplemented step 4, and they disagreed: the
wizard wrote all three tiers while ``integrations setup`` wrote only the store.
Runtime resolution hides that (it checks the store first), but anything reading
the environment — notably the deploy preflight in
``infrastructure/deployment/ecr_deploy/prep.py`` — sees a half-configured integration.

Callers now describe *what* the integration needs with an
:class:`IntegrationSetupSpec` and hand collected values to :func:`apply_setup`;
where each value lands is decided here, once.
