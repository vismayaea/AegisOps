"""Shared execution helpers for *agentic* (workspace-editing) CLI runs.

The adapters in this package cover the "brain" role: prompt in, text out.
Coding-agent backends (``integrations/coding_agent``, ``integrations/pi``) run
vendor CLIs in the inverse "hands" role — a long-lived child process that edits
a workspace. This module holds the backend-neutral machinery for that role:

- an injection-guarded task prompt (:func:`build_guarded_task_prompt`),
- deadline-polled subprocess execution with pipe draining
  (:func:`poll_agent_process`), and
- outcome classification incl. provider limit detection
  (:func:`classify_agent_outcome`).

It is a leaf: it imports nothing from ``integrations/pi`` or
``integrations/coding_agent`` so every backend can depend on it without cycles.
