"""Generic read access to any Yandex Cloud service.

Yandex Cloud has north of a hundred services. Giving each one a dedicated tool
would blow the per-investigation schema budget many times over, so the ones
that matter most for incident response get purpose-built tools and everything
else is reachable through this pair: one to discover what services exist, one
to read from any of them.

Reads only. The client refuses anything but GET, which across Yandex's
uniformly generated REST API means list and get and nothing that mutates.
