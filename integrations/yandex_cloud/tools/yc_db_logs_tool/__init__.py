"""Logs a managed database keeps for itself, outside Cloud Logging.

A managed cluster writes its own log stream and serves it from its own service
endpoint. Nothing of it reaches Cloud Logging unless the operator turned that
export on, so ``read_yc_logs`` coming back empty says only "not in Cloud
Logging" — which reads exactly like "there are no logs" and ends investigations
early.

Each engine keeps several streams and the endpoint serves one at a time. The
choice matters more than it looks: MySQL answers with its error log by default,
so a question about slow queries gets a confident empty answer unless
``MYSQL_SLOW_QUERY`` is asked for. ClickHouse refuses the read outright without
one.
