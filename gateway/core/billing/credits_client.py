"""Consume opensre-webapp credits before metered agent work.

Contract:
  POST {OPENSRE_WEBAPP_URL}/api/credits/consume
  Authorization: Bearer <shared AGENT_USAGE_SECRET>
  body: {"amount": <number>, "organizationId": <org>, "reason": <str>}
  Success (2xx): {"balance", "consumed", "reason"}.
  Shortfall: HTTP 402 with {"error": "insufficient_credits", "balance", "required"}.

The client only classifies the attempt — it never decides policy. A missing
webapp URL means metering is deliberately disabled for a self-hosted runtime;
an incomplete hosted configuration or ledger outage is a distinct failure so
production admission can fail closed.
