"""Transport-neutral approval gate for write tools in gateway turns.

Tools registered with ``requires_approval=True`` declare a human-in-the-loop
contract that the CLI honours with a ``Proceed? [Y/n]`` prompt. Chat gateways
honour it by posting Approve / Deny buttons and blocking the tool call until an
authorized member clicks or the request expires.

This module holds the parts that do not depend on a chat transport: the broker
that connects a click to the waiting tool call, the button identifiers, and the
harness hooks. Each transport supplies its own :class:`ApprovalPrompter` — Block
Kit in ``gateway.transports.slack.delivery.approvals``, message components in
``gateway.transports.discord.approvals``, inline keyboard in
``gateway.transports.telegram.approvals``.
