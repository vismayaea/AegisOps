"""Slack request-signature verification for Events API HTTP inbound.

Socket Mode authenticates once when the WebSocket opens. Over HTTP every
request must prove it came from Slack, so this is the transport's security
boundary: an unsigned or stale POST is an attacker, not a client.

Verification runs over the **raw** request body. Re-serializing parsed JSON
changes bytes (key order, separators) and the HMAC no longer matches, so the
route must hand the untouched bytes to :func:`verify_slack_signature`.
