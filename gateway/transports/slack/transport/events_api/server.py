"""Slack's own HTTP listener for Events API inbound.

A dedicated app on its own port, not a route added to :mod:`gateway.web`: that
app is the health and alert surface, and the package DAG forbids it importing a
chat transport. Keeping the listener here also keeps the two inbound transports
symmetrical — Socket Mode owns its connection in :mod:`.worker`, Events API
owns its server here.

Slack retries any delivery it does not see answered within three seconds, so
both routes verify, hand the message to ``handler`` on a worker thread, and
return immediately. The turn never runs inside the request.
