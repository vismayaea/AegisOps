"""Direct contract tests for the shared edit-in-place turn output base.

A recording fake channel pins the state machine the base owns — placeholder
open, in-place edits, and the id-release-on-finalize that makes a later
session-goal turn post a fresh message instead of overwriting a delivered
answer — independently of any transport's vendor I/O.
