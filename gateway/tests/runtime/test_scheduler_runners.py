"""Scheduled agentic-loop runs share the gateway's turn gate.

The scheduler runs agentic loop tasks (Sentry digest, PostHog report, GitHub PR
sweep, manual loop). Each one costs a turn, so it must take the same capacity
gate chat turns take, exactly once, and give it back even when the run fails.

The runners are a value the host gates once at construction and passes into the
scheduler, so these also pin that gating is a pure value transform that cannot
compound the way the old read-modify-write on module state could.
