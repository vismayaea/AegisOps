"""Every chat transport implements the same concerns — not just the same borders.

The border tests pin what transports may *not* do (import peers, reach around
the registry). Nothing pinned what each one *must* contain, and the newest
transport shipped without principal binding, a turn timeout, ``/stop`` or
credit metering while the whole border suite stayed green — the concerns were
copied from the nearest neighbour, minus whatever the copy dropped.

Concerns are detected in package source rather than by module name: Slack
may keep a concern in ``security.py`` while Telegram uses
``inbound_security.py``. Importing transport modules would pull platform
SDKs into this test.

Known gaps are a ledger, asserted *exactly*: fixing one fails the test until
its entry is removed, so the ledger can only shrink, and a new transport (auto-
discovered, never listed by hand) starts with no entries — fully conformant or
red.
