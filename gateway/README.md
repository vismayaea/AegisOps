# OpenSRE Messaging Gateway

Standalone inbound messaging gateway for chat platforms: Telegram DM text chat
via long polling, Slack mentions/DMs via **Socket Mode** (default) or **Events API
HTTP**, and Discord via Gateway WebSocket.

The gateway is a separate surface. Transports receive an injected turn runner;
agent startup and integration loading run through the shared harness, not
transport-specific code.

## Entry points

| What you want | File / symbol | How it is started |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Production entry** | CLI composition root (outside `gateway/`) | `opensre gateway start` / `--foreground` (injects slash ports) |
| **Package main** | `gateway/__main__.py` → `main()` | Fails closed — no slash-port glue |
| **Process composition root** | `gateway/core/lifecycle/controller.py` → `GatewayController` | Injected `slash_ports_factory` from CLI; bare `controller.main` fails closed |
| **Daemon (pidfile + spawn)** | `gateway/core/process/supervision.py` | Used by CLI `gateway start/stop/status` (pidfile + `components.json`); caller passes argv |
| **Web surface (web-only task)** | `gateway/web/webapp.py` → `app` | `uvicorn gateway.web.webapp:app` (`MODE=web` in Docker) |
| **Surface startup** | `gateway/startup.py` → `start_gateway` / `StartedGateway` | Called by `GatewayController.start_surfaces` |
| **Chat transport registry** | `gateway/transports/startup.py` → `TRANSPORTS` / `start_transports` | Used by `start_gateway` |
| **Telegram transport** | `gateway/transports/telegram/startup.py` → `start_telegram_worker` | Via the startup registry |
| **Slack transport** | `gateway/transports/slack/startup.py` → `start_slack_worker` | Via the startup registry |
| **Discord transport** | `gateway/transports/discord/startup.py` → `start_discord_worker` | Via the startup registry (includes readiness wait) |
| **Per-message turn** | `infrastructure/turn_host/turn_runner.py` → `TurnRunner` | Injected into chat transports as the agent callback |

Layout: `core/` (runtime, storage, …), `startup.py` (surface composer),
`transports/` (slack, discord, telegram peers), and `web/` (web surface). See
`AGENTS.md`.

## How the pieces fit (surfaces, gateway, integrations)

Three things that are easy to mix up.

A surface is how a person talks to the agent (message in, answer out). Today
there are three: the interactive shell (`surfaces/interactive_shell`), the
CLI one-shot (`surfaces/cli`), and the gateway (`gateway/`, chat apps).

The gateway is the always-on process that connects a chat app to the agent.
It speaks Telegram (long poll), Slack (Socket Mode or Events API HTTP), and
Discord (Gateway WebSocket). Slack's two inbound modes share the same turn
stack; only how the payload arrives differs
(`gateway/transports/slack/transport/`).

Integrations and tools are the outbound / teammate side: the agent reading
and posting on a platform. Slack's shared client is
`integrations/slack/web_client.py`. Common Slack tools:
`slack_send_message` (webhook), `slack_reply_message` (bot token, any
channel), `slack_read_messages` (history / thread),
`slack_list_team_members` (roster), plus search / join / react helpers
under `integrations/slack/tools/`. See `docs/messaging/slack.mdx` for
OAuth scopes. Telegram has `telegram_send_message`; Discord is gateway
chat plus delivery today (see `docs/messaging/discord.mdx`).

Inbound and outbound are independent per platform:

| | Inbound (person → agent) | Outbound / teammate tools |
|---|---|---|
| **Telegram** | Yes — `gateway/transports/telegram/` | Yes — integration + `telegram_send_message` |
| **Slack** | Yes — `gateway/transports/slack/` (Socket Mode by default; Events API HTTP optional; each thread is a conversation) | Yes — webhook + bot-token tools |
| **Discord** | Yes — `gateway/transports/discord/` (DMs, mentions, threads) | Delivery + slash registration |

**One core for every surface.** Shell, CLI, and the gateway transports all hand the
message to the same place: a session-scoped `HeadlessAgent`
(`agent.handle(...)` via `TurnRunner`). They differ only in *how they
receive input and send output* — never in how the agent thinks.

## Quick start

```bash
# Allow your Telegram user id (from @userinfobot)
uv run opensre messaging allow -p telegram -u 123456789

# Allow your Slack member id (profile → Copy member ID; see below)
uv run opensre messaging allow -p slack -u U0123ABCD

# Start the gateway daemon (web + chat). The process also hosts infrastructure.scheduling.scheduler.
uv run opensre gateway start
```

**Find your Slack user id (member ID):**

1. Open your profile in the Slack app (avatar / name).
2. Click **⋯** (More) next to **View as** / profile actions.
3. Choose **Copy member ID** — that value starts with `U…` and is what
   `SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS` / `messaging allow -p slack -u …` need.
4. Do **not** use `@display-name` (e.g. `@Yauhen`); only the member ID is stable.

Both transports load configuration the same way: tokens from env first with the
integration store as fallback; allowed users from the integration store
(written by `opensre messaging allow`) first with the `*_ALLOWED_USERS` env
var as fallback.

DM your bot from Telegram, mention/DM it in Slack, or chat in Discord (see
`docs/messaging/` for app setup). Slack Socket Mode needs no public URL; Events
API HTTP needs a reachable URL and `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token |
| `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` | Comma-separated Telegram user ids |
| `TELEGRAM_GATEWAY_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Parallel turns across chats (default 4) |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Slack bot token (`xoxb-…`) |
| `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` | Slack app-level token for Socket Mode (`xapp-…`) |
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | Slack signing secret for Events API HTTP request verification |
| `SLACK_GATEWAY_INBOUND_TRANSPORT` | `socket_mode` (default) or `events_api_http` |
| `SLACK_GATEWAY_HTTP_PORT` | Port for the Events API HTTP listener (default `3000`) |
| `SLACK_GATEWAY_ALLOW_LOCAL_DEDUP` | `1` allows process-local event dedup for Events API (single replica only) |
| `SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS` | Comma-separated Slack user ids (required unless open workspace) |
| `SLACK_ALLOW_OPEN_WORKSPACE` | `1` allows any workspace member (dogfood only) |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Discord bot token |
| `DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS` | Comma-separated Discord user snowflakes |
| `DISCORD_ALLOW_OPEN_GUILD` | `1` allows any guild member (dogfood only) |

Pairing via `opensre messaging pair` uses the same integration-store policy as the gateway.

## Adding a chat platform

The message handler is **transport-agnostic** — it takes
`(text, session, output, logger)` and knows nothing about any platform. To add a
platform you do **not** touch the agent, prompts, or tools. You add one package
with the same five pieces `gateway/transports/telegram/` and `gateway/transports/slack/` both have:

1. **Settings** (`settings.py`): env-backed config, raising
   `GatewayConfigurationError` (from `gateway/core/lifecycle/errors.py`) when missing.
2. **A listener** (`startup.py` + the transport worker): receives inbound
   messages and calls the shared handler with `(text, session, output, logger)`.
3. **Inbound security**: authorize each message and audit-log it
   (`integrations/messaging_security`).
4. **Turn output** (implement `TurnOutput` from
   `infrastructure/turn_host/turn_output.py`): streams status and delivers the answer.
5. **Session binding** via `gateway/core/storage/session/resolver.py` with a new
   `platform` value: map the platform conversation key to a `Session`.

Then register it in the composition root (`GatewayController` in
`gateway/core/lifecycle/controller.py`) beside the existing transports. Reuse the handler
from `TurnRunner(...)` as-is.

**What you never change:** `TurnRunner`, harness prompts/tools, or the
session agent pool. Keeping the handler transport-agnostic is exactly what makes
a new platform a small, self-contained add.
