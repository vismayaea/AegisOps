"""Registration steps a process opts into, one function per step.

``surfaces`` and ``gateway`` may not import each other, so each used to keep a
byte-identical copy of this registration and synchronise it by comment. It lives
here once; :mod:`bootstrap.process` composes the steps a profile asks for.

Imports stay inside the functions: registration pulls in the tool and
integration registries, and a host that only needs adapters should not pay for
the scheduler ones.
