"""Holding one of a process's turn slots, and the two policies for a full gate.

A turn costs an LLM budget and a worker thread, so a process caps how many run
at once. Every caller then faces the same question — what to do when the cap is
reached — and there are exactly two answers:

* **Drop.** A request that can be told "try again": a chat message, an HTTP
  turn. It gets an immediate answer instead of an open connection.
* **Wait.** Work already claimed from a queue: a scheduled run, the HTTP
  worker. Dropping it would lose it, so it queues for a slot.

Both are stated here so a caller picks a policy rather than reimplementing one,
and so ``acquire``/``release`` are never paired by hand — a missing ``finally``
leaks a slot, and a leaked slot is a process that answers "at capacity" forever.
