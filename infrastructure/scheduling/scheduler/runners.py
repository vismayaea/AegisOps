"""The runner a scheduled task dispatches through, bundled as one value.

A scheduled agentic-loop task (Sentry digest, PostHog report, GitHub PR sweep,
manual loop) runs through a registered runner. It used to be installed as a
side effect and then *rewritten* in place by the gateway to add its capacity
gate — a read-modify-write on module state that was not idempotent, so gating
twice made one run cost two permits.

Here the runner is a value instead. :meth:`SchedulerRunners.gated` returns a
new bundle rather than mutating a registered one, so a host states its gate
once, at construction, and double-gating has no shape to happen in.

The bundle is assembled by the composition root (``bootstrap.adapters``), which
is the only layer allowed to see both ``integrations`` and ``tools``.
