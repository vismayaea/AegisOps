"""Dispatch one inbound message through the shared headless agent.

This is the **only** turn runner. Transport dispatchers
(Slack/Discord/Telegram) are ingress adapters: they authorize, resolve a
session, build turn output, then call this callback. Process-wide capacity is an
optional gate on the same object — not a second runner.

Transport-agnostic: takes ``(text, session, output, logger)``, runs the turn, and
finalizes outbound text on the output. Agent reuse is handled by
:class:`SessionAgentPool`.

Two entries, one turn. :meth:`TurnRunner.__call__` is the
``TurnCallback`` the four chat transports use and returns nothing.
:meth:`TurnRunner.run` is the same turn for an in-process caller that
needs the outcome as a value and has a terminal to bind — it returns the
``TurnResult`` (``None`` at capacity) and accepts the caller's console,
``confirm_fn`` and ``is_tty``. Every keyword defaults to the transport path, so
the two entries cannot drift apart.
