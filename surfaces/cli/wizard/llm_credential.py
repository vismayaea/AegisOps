"""Onboarding LLM-credential helpers: prompt, validate, persist, and recover.

Extracted from ``surfaces/cli/wizard/flow.py`` so the wizard's top-level control
flow (``run_wizard``) stays readable and this credential-specific logic lives in one
place (#4055 review). ``run_wizard`` imports the public helpers from here — this
module must never import ``flow`` (that would be a cycle); it depends only on the
same lower-level sources ``flow`` uses: ``components``, ``validation``, ``env_sync``,
``config``, and the shared theme.
