"""The onboarding wizard's configurator for any spec-driven integration.

This is the *collection* half of setup, and the counterpart to
:mod:`integrations.setup_flow`: that module takes values someone already
gathered and decides where they are persisted, while this one is what asks the
user for them.

Every configurator built on an :class:`~integrations.setup_flow.IntegrationSetupSpec`
does the same three things — prompt for each field (prefilled from whatever is
already stored, so re-running onboarding is not a retype), hand the answers to
:func:`~integrations.setup_flow.apply_setup`, and re-ask on failure instead of
dropping the user out of the wizard. Only the heading and the introductory
guidance differ, so those are the arguments.
