"""The ``opensre`` process entrypoint: composes the CLI, the interactive shell and the gateway entry.

The surfaces are peers and do not import each other; this module is the one
place that knows all of them. A bare ``opensre`` on a terminal opens the shell,
``opensre <command>`` runs the CLI, and ``opensre gateway start --foreground``
runs the gateway attached — each through a callable handed to the CLI as its
:class:`~surfaces.cli.host.CliHost`. The console script and the frozen binary
both start here, so neither loses the shell.
