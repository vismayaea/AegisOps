"""Live token streaming for interactive-shell LLM responses.

The interactive REPL pins the input box at the bottom of the terminal
via ``patch_stdout``. To keep the input editable while a response
streams (type-ahead) we can't use :class:`rich.live.Live` — ``Live``
does cursor manipulation (cursor-up + erase-line) for in-place redraw,
which fights ``patch_stdout`` and blocks the input buffer from
accepting keystrokes.

Instead this path streams **paragraph-by-paragraph**, with a bounded-latency
fallback for very long prose paragraphs: chunks accumulate in ``para_buffer``
and a complete paragraph (text up to the next ``\\n\\n`` outside an open
code-fence) renders as ``rich.Markdown`` the moment its boundary is seen. Long
partial prose is also flushed once it grows past a small character budget, so a
10k-word single paragraph does not sit invisible until end-of-stream. Code
blocks are kept whole — we never split on ``\\n\\n`` or partial-size thresholds
while a triple-backtick fence is unclosed.

Streaming progress and cancellation are surfaced through optional
attributes on the ``console``: ``update_streaming_progress(bytes)`` is
called per chunk (throttled to ~10/s) so the bottom-toolbar token
counter updates live, and ``cancel_requested`` is polled between chunks
so an Esc press in the prompt cancels promptly. The ``getattr``
indirection keeps this module decoupled from the ``StreamingConsole`` adapter.

Gather answers may set ``defer_want_me_to_closer`` so dual/drifted Want-me-to
menus are not rendered until the harness flushes the canonical closer.
