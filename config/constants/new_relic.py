"""New Relic environment variable names and NerdGraph operational constants.

The two numeric constants below are split by ownership: the timeout and the
result-limit ceiling are New Relic's own operational limits (verified against
official NerdGraph docs, 2026-08-11), while the default incident limit and
window are OpenSRE's own choices, sized for LLM context (NFR-8) rather than
the API's ceiling.
