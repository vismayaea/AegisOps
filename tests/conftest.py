    exercise those paths (the onboarding wizard, provider switching, etc.) do
    not ``monkeypatch`` every key the code touches, so without this snapshot the

    ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` made later ``live_llm`` planner contracts resolve the
    fallback (credit-exhausted anthropic) provider and skip. Restoring the full
    environment after each test contains that whole class of leakage.

    write ``~/.opensre/opensre.json`` (and credential resolution writes
    ``~/.opensre/llm-auth.json``) with no per-test opt-in required, so any test
    exercising those paths that forgets to monkeypatch ``get_store_path``
    individually silently corrupts the *developer's real* config and credential
    metadata (observed as ``opensre.json`` cycling through unrelated test
    providers, and a valid provider getting marked stale, while ``make
    test-cov`` ran). Setting both overrides here makes every test safe by
    default; a test that needs a specific path can still override it via
    ``monkeypatch`` or by passing an explicit ``path=`` argument.

    Memory storage is also redirected for every test so deterministic prompt
    snapshots never read the developer's real ``~/.opensre/memory`` directory.
    Background memory extraction is disabled by default because most tests use
    tiny fake LLM clients and assert the exact prompt/stream call shape; the
    memory-specific tests remove this env var in their own fixture.

    The wizard/LLM-auth overrides mirror the ``live_llm`` exemption on
    ``_disable_system_keyring`` above: live LLM turn tests need the real
    ``~/.opensre/llm-auth.json`` metadata for CLI-subscription providers, whose
    prompt-safe ``status()`` reads the metadata record directly rather than an
