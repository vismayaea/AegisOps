"""What a surface may depend on: not its peer, and not the gateway's insides.

``surfaces/cli`` and ``surfaces/interactive_shell`` are peers: what both need
lives below them (``surfaces/shared``, ``config``, ``core``, ``infrastructure``).
Surfaces may also drive the gateway *process* — start it, stop it, read its
status — but not reach into its transports, storage or middleware.

Every edge is pinned as an exact allowlist so it can only shrink: a new import
fails immediately, and an entry no longer imported must be removed.
Underscore-prefixed names never cross.
