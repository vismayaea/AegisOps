"""A mock agent whose ``handle`` is the harness's real host loop over the mock's ``bind_turn``/``dispatch``.

Host tests fake the agent to assert what the host binds and dispatches. Since
hosts call :meth:`HeadlessAgent.handle`, the fake must run the same loop the
real agent does — bind the turn, dispatch, continue while a session goal is
attached — so ``bind_turn.call_args`` and ``dispatch.call_count`` keep meaning
what they meant.
