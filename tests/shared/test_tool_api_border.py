"""Consumers import the tool packages through their public API, and the surface only shrinks.

``core/tool/`` (contract, execution, registry port) and ``core/tool_framework/``
(``@tool``, skill guidance, payload utilities) are one group to everything above
them. Three public API modules are the allowed way in: ``core.tool`` (the
contract — what a tool is, how it runs, where it is registered),
``core.tool_framework`` (the ``@tool`` decorator, planning tags, skill guidance),
and ``core.tool_framework.utils`` (schema builders, MCP readers, availability
envelopes). Any import reaching past those is listed below, and these allowlists
measure how far off that rule the code still is.

Every consumer is now at zero: they use the public API modules and nothing behind them.

Each allowlist is compared exactly in both directions: a new internal import
fails immediately, and an entry no longer imported must be removed.
