"""``github_cli`` bounds its own output instead of letting the context budget cut it.

A raw ``gh api`` list endpoint answers with the whole object graph — 30 workflow
runs is roughly 382k characters. Unbounded, that reached the message and the
context budget trimmed the tail silently, so the agent read a couple of records
and reported a 0% failure rate computed from one run. Capping here keeps the cut
visible: the payload says ``truncated`` so the reply can admit what it missed.
