"""Which providers each delivery consumer actually supports, stated once.

``Provider`` offers six members to every caller, and no caller supports all
six. Each consumer picks a subset, and until now those subsets lived in prose:
the enum docstring says consumers "define their own documented subset rather
than exposing a choice that would silently fail".

This file is that documentation as an assertion. Each expectation below is
compared for exact equality against what the code can actually reach, so a new
provider, a removed branch, or a consumer quietly widening its support fails
here rather than at a user's delivery time.
