"""A session-goal continuation turn must know what earlier turns established.

Observed live: turn 1 fetched weather and news successfully and printed the
figures; a later turn ran one slash command, saw no weather tool among *its*
results, and answered "current weather and news retrieval is unavailable in
this environment". The work had been done and the agent reported that it had
not been.

Each continuation is a fresh ``chat`` call carrying only the nudge, and
``record_conversation_turn`` stores assistant prose — never tool payloads. So
nothing hands turn N+1 the evidence turn N gathered.
