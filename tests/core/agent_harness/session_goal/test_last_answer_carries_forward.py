"""A continuation turn is told what the previous turn already answered.

Asked "how many github actions runs failed in the last 24 hours?", turn 1
answered "73 out of 800 completed" from conversation history — no tool ran. That
left no ``finding`` (findings require tool evidence), so turn 2 re-derived the
number by another route, reported 12, and closed the goal. The user saw two
counts for one question with nothing reconciling them.

``last_answer`` is the weaker channel: recorded whether or not a tool ran, and
rendered as "already told the user" rather than as established fact, so an
unverified answer cannot become settled by being repeated.
