"""Characterization of the action turn's outcome, field by field.

``_run_action_turn`` is one long function doing three unrelated jobs: building
the agent, running it, and turning what happened into a
``ToolCallingTurnResult`` plus console output.

These assert on complete values rather than single fields, so a refactor that
drops or reorders part of the composed text fails here rather than in a
customer's terminal.
