"""One shape for a history row, whichever session records it.

``SessionCore`` and the headless adapter both append rows that tools read back
— ``propose_scheduled_delivery`` checks them for evidence that a fetch ran. The
two used to build the dict independently with the same conditional-insert
block, so a field added to one would silently be missing from the other.
