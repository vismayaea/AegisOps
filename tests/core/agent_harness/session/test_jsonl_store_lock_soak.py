"""Cross-process soak matrix for the session file lock (#5497).

The same-process tests in ``test_jsonl_store_lock.py`` cannot distinguish a
working lock from one that merely appears to work: a lock's happy path looks
identical either way. These four cases run real writer processes, because the
crash case needs a process the OS can kill and the concurrency cases need
writers that are not sharing an interpreter lock.

Run with ``-s`` to see the per-run lock-wait, timeout, and decode-failure
numbers; they are printed for every case and are the signal worth watching
while the lock is young.
