"""``list_memories`` must reuse parsed records without ever serving stale ones.

Every action-agent turn renders the memory index, so the whole store was read
and parsed per turn — a cost that grows as a user accumulates memories. Records
are now reused until the files change.

Correctness is the whole game here: a cache that misses a write is a agent that
answers from a memory the user just deleted or edited. These tests exercise each
way the store can change.
